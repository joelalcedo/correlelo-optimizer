Identification of optimal time-lagged correlations

Use this code to identify correlations across lag periods to support various modelling techniques. 

Warning: lags approaching end of sample will result in a convergence near 1. This tool should be used as a means to quickly inspect optimal lag selection (which can sometimes be more of an art than a science!) between two variables.
